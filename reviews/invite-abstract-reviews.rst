Dear |conference| |year| Program Committee:

I am happy to report that we have received several high quality abstracts for
the |conference| |year| conference. Now, it is our task to rate these abstracts
and to choose the best ones for presentation.

Of the |submitted| abstracts, you are each requested to review |toreview|, as
set out in the table below. Of course, you are more than welcome (and
encouraged!) to review more, if time permits. We have until the end of this
coming |duedate|; I realise this is not a lot of time, but I estimate the total
commitment for each reviewer to be no more than one hour in total.

<insert review table>

The process works as follows:

 1. Look up the papers you need to review on the table above.
 2. Download the paper and score sheet from |downloadurl|.
 3. For each reviewed abstract, fill in the appropriate marks on the provided
    score sheet.
 4. Email the score sheet to |email|.

Three marks are awarded per abstract:

- Applicability (/10)
- Novelty (/10)
- General impression (/10)

We will use the average of the 3 marks to do the final evaluation. The "General
impression" field is necessarily vague: use it to impart your gut feel about
the abstract. A comment field is provided, please share any additional
thoughts.

Thank you for giving your time to shape this year's conference!

With best regards,
