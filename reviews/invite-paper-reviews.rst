Subject:  [scipy2010 proceedings] 

Dear colleague and friend,

Considering your expertise we would like to invite you to review the two
attached articles for the SciPy |year| conference proceedings. The submitted
papers are based on this year's conference presentations. Conference
presentations were selected by the program committee based on the submitted
abstracts according to the follow criteria:  applicability, novelty, and
general impression.  Each abstract was reviewed by at least four reviewers. Of
the |abstracts| submitted abstracts, we have |papers| submitted papers to review.

If you are willing to review the attached papers, please respond in the next
three days. If you accept, please submit your review to |emails| by |due|.

The purpose of the conference proceedings is to increase the visibility of the
conference and the presented work as well as provide academic recognition of
the significant contributions made by the developers of software for science
and engineering. To ensure the published proceedings are of sufficiently high
quality we have have instituted a formal review process and each paper will be
reviewed by at least two reviewers according to explicit and uniform criteria.

The primary goal of the review process is to provide independent feedback to
the authors to improve the paper. To review the paper, please complete the
attached review form. While we are soliciting recommendations from reviewers
regarding whether each paper should be accepted for publication, the final
decision on whether a paper is accepted will be made by the proceeding's
editors (|editors|) based on the independent reviews.

Of course, you are more than welcome (and encouraged!) to review additional
papers, if time and interest permits.  You can browse the submitted papers

Please be aware that all reviews are made public including the reviewer's name.

With best regards,
