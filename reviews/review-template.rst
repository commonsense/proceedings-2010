SPECIFIC EVALUATION
-------------------

For the following questions, please respond with 'yes' or 'no'.  If you
answer 'no',  please provide a brief, one- to two-sentence explanation.

- Is the code made publicly available and does the article sufficiently
  describe how to access it?  We aim not to publish papers that essentially
  advertise propetiary software.  Therefore, if the code is not publicly available,
  please provide a one- to two- sentence response to each of the following
  questions: 

  - Does the article focus on a topic other than the features
    of the software itself?
  - Can the majority of statements made be externally validated
    (i.e., without the use of the software)?
  - Is the information presented of interest to readers other than
    those at whom the software is aimed?
  - Is there any other aspect of the article that would
    justify including it despite the fact that the code
    isn't available?
  - Does the article discuss the reasons the software is closed?
   
- Does the article present the problem in an appropriate context?
  Specifically, does it:
  
  - explain why the problem is important,
  - describe in which situations it arises,
  - outline relevant previous work, 
  - provide background information for non-experts 

- Is the content of the paper accessible to a computational scientist
  with no specific knowledge in the given field?

- Does the paper describe a well-formulated scientific or technical
  achievement?

- Are the technical and scientific decisions well-motivated and
  clearly explained?

- Are the code examples (if any) sound, clear, and well-written?

- Is the paper factual correct?

- Is the language and grammar of sufficient quality?

- Are the conclusions justified?

- Is prior work properly and fully cited?

- Should any part of the article be shortened or expanded? Please explain.

- In your view, is the paper fit for publication in the SciPy proceedings?
  Please suggest specific improvements and indicate whether you think the
  article needs a significant rewrite (rather than a minor revision).
